#Rock, Paper and Scissor

Welcome to Rock, Paper and Scissor Game.

Rock, paper, scissor is the basic game to build. In this Project, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In HTML, a header, a score board, a label to represent the resul and 3 icons.

In Css, I have used different properties like background color, border-radius, font-size, color,
width and height of the container, hover over icon div, and more and it's also resposive Design for Best Experience.

In javascript, I have used 3 event add Listener, and created a function game, the game function is the main function.
For Computer Choice, I generate a random number between 0 to 2 and decide on the number it will take computer choice.
Then switch case, check all possibilites winning, losing and tie.
